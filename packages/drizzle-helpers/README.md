# Drizzle Helpers

This package was created to share some common db code and patterns between many projects.  Features, enhancements, and bug fixes 
can be DRY.

### Migration script: migrate/index.ts

requires
* process.env.DATABASE_URL
* modules `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` and `postgres`.  See Dockerfile and entrypoint.sh for examples of how it could be used in production

example package.json script:
```
  "drizzle:migrate": "dotenv -e ./.env.local node node_modules/drizzle-helpers/dist/migrate ./src/server/db/migrations",
  "drizzle:migrate:prod": "node node_modules/drizzle-helpers/dist/migrate ./src/server/db/migrations",
```

### Connection 
* optimized for next.js dev reloading to avoid connection limits (reuse initialization)
see DrizzleConnect.ts for code.

## ORM
* criteria builder
* create/update methods assume returning one and shift for cleaner service code
* pagination support for offset
* order by support
see DrizzleOrm.ts for more.
