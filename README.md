# nextjs-boilerplate

## Getting Started

- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (necessary to build/run next.js)
- Install Docker or Rancher Desktop ([recommended](https://codeengineered.com/blog/2022/docker-desktop-vs-rancher-desktop/))
- Install package manager. bun ([recommended](https://bun.sh/))
  - `npm install -g bun`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and edit variables

## Development mode

- `bun dev` - migrations, package check, docker, graphql codegen watcher then `next dev`
- `bun dev:init` - just the next.js dev server

  - persisted queries
- analytics
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt with [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap)

## Alternatives and Inspiration

- [BisonApp](https://github.com/echobind/bisonapp) - Worth reading [why they use tRPC](https://echobind.com/post/why-we-ditched-graphql-for-trpc). I believe gql is still better for corporate projects and [this](https://wundergraph.com/blog/trpc_vs_graphql) is worth a read..
- [T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) - highly recommended starting point
- [next-13-app-router-with-trpc](https://github.com/solaldunckel/next-13-app-router-with-trpc) - some patterns to consider.

## Notes

### Bun vs pnpm

Recommend pnpm for projects that need stability.  
Bun is worth trying out for personal R&D and may be the future of node in a year.

### Deployments

Strongly recommend deploying to Vercel until the cost at scale is prohibitive.
When you need other solutions:

- [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) serverless containerized deployment

  - see [cloudbuild.yaml](/cloudbuild.yaml) and [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)

- [SST](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs)

  - for those already in and experienced with AWS.
  - next.js releases seem to constantly break latest SST release in ways that are not clearly announced.

- Cloudflare [Next-On-Pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages)
  - ideal for marketing sites. Still maturing rapidly for anything beyond that, check their github issues.
  - Sentry not supported at time of writing (but discussions are in progress).
  - next-on-pages deployed on special workers so capabilities are not always comparable to workers

### Graphql playground

http://localhost:3000/api/graphql
To connect authenticated: `Connection Settings > Edit > Include Cookies > on`

### Database type

CockroachDB was chosen for combination of free tier, postgres compatability, and ultimate scalability.
Some cons

- it doesn't offer edge compatability
- it isn't officially supported in drizzle yet. Migrations with `DO $$` need to be manually converted to `IF NOT EXISTS`

Alternatives:

- Supabase - Wanted something beyond vanilla postgres on backend.
- Neon - love the serverless, branching model, and edge support. Doesn't yet offer in place version upgrades and not interested in doing export/import in production.
- Cloudflare D1 - waiting until it is GA and offers bottomless storage for further consideration.

### To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:

Add this to hosts `127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal`

### Auth

To switch to firebaseui this might be relevant: https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web-react/pull/173

Alternatives:

- Next-Auth - Doesn't seem to work cross-platform like React-Native which is critical to me for future safety.
- Clerk - didn't work for me out of the box. [issue](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-next-app-router-starter/issues/4#issuecomment-1681753103)
- Supabase - didn't feel comfortable proceeding with it. Here is a [post](https://bombillazo.medium.com/why-i-cannot-fully-recommend-supabase-yet-f8e994201804) with some similar feelings for consideration.

### Favicon

this is what I use to generate quick ones: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
I was using next.js [app directory conversion](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons) but it was adding startup time.

## pg module instead of postgres.js

If you do want pg, note this issue that needed manual patching at time of writing:
https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/2980#issuecomment-1658765692

# Git branches cleanup

To cleanup branches, I am using this alias:
`git config --global alias.branch-prune '!git fetch -p && for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='\''%(if:equals=[gone])%(upstream:track)%(then)%(refname:short)%(end)'\'' refs/heads); do git branch -d $b; done'`
Then run this to delete them safely
`git branch-prune`
